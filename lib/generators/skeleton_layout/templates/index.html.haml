      %h3 About Skeleton?
      %p Skeleton is a small collection of well-organized CSS &amp; JS files that can help you rapidly develop sites that look beautiful at any size, be it a 17" laptop screen or an iPhone. It's based on a responsive grid, but also provides very basic CSS for typography, buttons, tabs, forms and media queries. Go ahead, resize this super basic page to see the grid in action.

        %li
          %strong Style Agnostic
          %span : It provides the most basic, beautiful styles, but is meant to be overwritten.
